                        <p> Hello World! My Name is Chris Kalama and I am a graduate of the Northwestern Full Stack Bootcamp. I am 24 years old and was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois and its surround suburbs. More specifically Arlington Heights and Mount Prospect. In 2014, I graduated from high school and attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City. In Iowa City, I was immersed in a real life college-town feel, and fell in love with the aura it held. I lived in Iowa City (yes, lived there: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) for over 4 years obtaining my degree in Psychology, Political Science, and a certificate in U.S History while bartending at a Whiskey and Craft Beer Bar. Most of my life, I worked with my hands. My father owns an electrical contracting company and he instilled within me strong work ethic and not being afraid of dirty work or work that is hard. My mother is an extremely analytical individual and she has been an Accountant and Controller for most her career. She instilled within me compassion and never giving up on my goals. Despite my parent's knowledge, leaving Iowa City in 2018 I was in a lost state of mind. I knew that I wished to help people. But I just didn't know how. I worked in customer service, food-service, labor, and construction but truly had no real corporate experience...</p>
                        <p>I leveraged my connections and landed a job as a Supply Chain Recruiter. In my first real-world experience, I gained valuable skills to complete deadlines efficiently, asking the right questions, and getting in front of clients for professional meetings. Excelling in this role, I took a job offer in downtown Chicago (Off Wacker and Adams) as an IT Recruiter/Account Manager. I gravitated towards the Tech side because it was something that always interested me. I knew that my generation was endowed with Technology and its evolution for most of our formative years. I wanted to take advantage of that nimbleness and excel. Moving up quickly due to high internal turnover, I landed two large clients in the Chicagoland area. Despite this, the business did not last long in the Tech field, and my entire team was culled.</p>

                        <p>Starting the Year of 2020 unemployed, I needed to find a job. Thankfully, with my skills earned in my previous two careers. I was able to land a job in an entry level management for another Tech Recruitment Consultancy. This company specialized in the Salesforce eco-system. And that is when my interest started to peak in Tech. </p>

                    <div class="col-md-4 align-self-end">
                        <p>Learning more and more about SFDC really made have an ephiphany with my life. For the last 2 years, I was working so hard to be the guy to find the guy. I wasn't the man being contacted for my skills, I was the one with the skills to contact someone else and try and negotiate them a better opportunity. I realized that Consultancy wasn't my true calling. So, I contacted a friend of mine in the IT world and asked for some guidance. He recommended a Udemy class on Java. I bought it the next day and began trying it out.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p>Then, COVID-19 hit. And I lost my job. Again. I wasn't as discouraged this time around and focused on my class with Java. I ended up really enjoying it and bought another class in Javascript. I don't know why, but it just made sense to me, logically and passionately. One day, I was scrolling through the Internet and my girlfriend sent me a link to a Northwestern Bootcamp. I applied to it and heard back from an Advisor the next day. Seeing the potential I have now, with everything I have learned so far, and now having the proper tools and resources to achieve my goals. I have a new vigor. I am looking forward to continuing my education and finding a career that makes me truly happy.</p>
